# Elearning Website for a Thanwia A'ama Teacher (due to the COVID restrictions)
An Arabic teacher required a platform where he can upload his lectures and quizzes for his students.
For each lecture added the system produces a specific number (as requested by the admin) of unique 5-char codes (ex: **EX123*). These codes are then compiled to an excel file that can be downloaded.
Each code allows access to the added lecture only for 24 hours on one device only (uses many metrics like screen size, browser version, etc.. to get an accurate estimate of the client used).
The teacher prints these codes and sells them to his students individually.

The system had an admin portal where the admin can upload new lectures, upload new quizzes (with a specific duration), access a lecture to see which codes where used and which expired, edit information of added content.

## Technologies Used:
- HTML (EJS)
- CSS
- JS
- NODEJS
- EXPRESSJS
- MONGODB
- LINUX (to host the website on the server)
